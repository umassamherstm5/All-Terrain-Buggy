# All-Terrain-Buggy
The All-Terrain Buggy is a buggy that goes on most if not all terrains. 

It is a 6-wheeled AWD remote controlled vehicle. The motors are driven by the DRV8871 motor drivers. 
The buggy is controlled via a FlySky remote that feeds PWM signals into an Adafruit Feather 328P MCU.  

This project contains the firmware for the Feather 328P and all KiCad files for the buggy's custom PCB.
